<h3 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Biography</span> fails, like psychology, because it so
often mistakes complexity for illumination. Its
aim is to present a complete picture of a man;
its effect is usually to make an impenetrable mystery of
him. The cause of this, it seems to me, lies in the fact
that the biographer always tries to explain him utterly,
to account for him in every detail, to give an unbroken
coherence to all his acts and ideas. The result is a wax
dummy, as smooth as glass but as unalive as a dill pickle.</p>

<p>It is by no such process of exhaustion that we get our
notions of the people we really know. We see them, not
as complete images, but as processions of flashing points.
Their personalities, so to speak, are not revealed brilliantly
and in the altogether, but as shy things that peep
out, now and then, from inscrutable swathings, giving
us a hint, a suggestion, a moment of understanding.
Does a man really know what is going on in his wife’s
mind? Not if she <em>has</em> a mind. What he knows is only
that infinitesimal part which she reveals, sometimes
deliberately and even truculently, but more often naïvely,
surreptitiously, accidentally. He judges her as a human
being, not by anything approaching entire knowledge
of her, but by bold and scattered inferences. He sees
her soul, in so far as he sees it at all, in the way she buttons
her boots, in the way she intrigues for a kiss, in the way
she snaps her eye at him when he has been naughty—interprets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span> 
her ego in terms of her taste in ribbons,
the scent of her hair, her quarrels with her sisters, her
fashion of eating artichokes, her skill at home millinery,
the débris on her dressing table, her preferences in the
theater, her care of her teeth.</p>

<p>Thus, by slow degrees, he accumulates an image of
her—an image changing incessantly, and never more
than half sensed. After long years, perhaps, he begins
to know her after a fashion. That is, he knows how many
shredded wheat biscuits she likes for breakfast, how
much of his business she understands, how long she can
read a first-class novel without napping, what she thinks
of woolen underwear, the New Irish Movement, the
family doctor, soft-boiled eggs, and God....</p>

<p>I enter upon these considerations because I have been
employed by a committee of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">aluminados</i>, heeled well
enough to pay my honorarium, to conjure up recognizable
images of MM. George Jean Nathan and H. L. Mencken,
that their scattered partisans and the public generally
may see them more clearly. The job has its difficulties,
for save in their joint editorial concern with <cite>The Smart
Set</cite> magazine and their common antipathy to certain
prevailing sophistries, they are no more alike than a
hawk and a handsaw. But in one other thing, at least,
they also coalesce, and that is in the paucity of news
about them. Most other magazine editors are constantly
in the papers—discoursing on the literary art,
agitating for this or that, getting themselves interviewed.
These twain, however, pursue a more <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pianissimo</i> course,
and so not much is known about them, even inaccurately....</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The job invites. One reads regularly what magazine
editors think of their contributors, but who ever reads
what magazine contributors—of whom I, Hatteras, am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
one—think of their editors? A vast and adventurous
field here enrolls itself, believe me. I know, more or less
intimately, most of the editors of the great American periodicals,
and I am constantly amused by the inaccuracy
of the prevailing notions about them—notions diligently
fostered, in many cases, by their own more or less
subtle chicane. Consider, for example, the dean of the
order, M. George Harvey, of the <cite>North American Review</cite>.
His portrait shows a thoughtful old gentleman reading
a book, his forefinger pressed affectionately against his
right frontal sinus. Recalling the high mental pressure
of his daily concerns, one concludes at once that he is
struggling through Talboys Wheeler’s epitome of the
Maha-Bhārāta, or Locke’s “Conduct of the Understanding.”
But I have it from the Colonel himself—a
confidence quite spontaneous and apparently sincere—that
at the precise moment the photographer squeezed
the bird he was thinking—what? Simply this: how
much prettier Mlle. Mary Pickford would be if her lower
limbs were less richly developed laterally. The book was
the <cite>Photoplay Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>Again, there is M. Robert H. Davis, editor of the
Munsey publications. The official views of M. Davis
depict him as a man of the great outdoors, a stalker of
the superior carnivora, a dead shot, a fisher of tarpons
and sharks, a rover of the primeval forests. He is dressed
up like a cover of <cite>Field and Stream</cite>, a doggish pipe in his
mouth, his tropics formidably encircled by cartridges
and fish worms. But what are the facts? The facts
are that Davis does all his fishing in the Fulton Market,
and that the bear-skin which in his pictures he is seen
holding triumphantly at arm’s length actually graces
his library floor and was bought at Revillon Frères. He
is a God-fearing, mild-mannered, and respectable man,
an admirer of Elihu Root, a Prohibitionist, a member
of the Red Cross and the S. P. C. A. The only actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
hunting he ever does is to hunt for someone to agree
with him that M. Irvin Cobb is a greater man than
Mark Twain or Dostoievsky. And when it comes to
fishing, he has said all he has to say when he brings up a
couple of sardellen out of the mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Yet again, there are such fellows as Doty, of the
<cite>Century</cite>; Towne, of <cite>McClure’s</cite>; Bok, of the <cite>Ladies’
Home Journal</cite>; Siddall, of the <cite>American</cite>; and Fox, of
the <cite>Police Gazette</cite>. Doty prints Edith Wharton and
Rabindranath Tagore—and reads, by choice, H. C.
Witwer and Selma Lagerlöf. Fox collects Chinese jades
and Sheraton chairs, and is a member of the Lake Mohonk
Conference. Siddall used to be a hoochie-coochie sideshow
ballyhoo with Ringling’s Circus. Towne, throwing
off the editorial mask of moral indignation, writes tender
triolets in the privacy of his chambers. Bok, viewed
popularly as a muff—the wags of the National Press
Club once put him down as one of the ladies entertained
by them—is a rough, wild creature, a huge, knobby
Hollander, with a voice like an auctioneer’s. And Eastman
of the <cite>Masses</cite>, the prophet of revolt, the savior of
the oppressed—what of Eastman? Eastman, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au naturel</i>,
gives no more damns for the oppressed than you or
I. His aim in life, the last time I met him in society,
was to find a chauffeur who was not a drunkard and had
no flair for debauching the parlor-maids. On this theme
he pumped up ten times the eloquence he has ever emitted
over Unearned Increments and Wage Slaves.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In a similar way are the MM. George Jean Nathan
and H. L. Mencken misviewed. And it is because I
see here an opportunity to experiment with my private
theory of biography that I enter with some enjoyment
the enterprise, thus thrown on me, of exhibiting the facts.
To this end, I herewith present a list of the things I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
happen to know about the two gentlemen in question,
leaving whoever cares for the job to go through it and
construct for himself a definite and symmetrical effigy. So:</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="GEORGE_JEAN_NATHAN">GEORGE JEAN NATHAN</h2>
</div>

<p>He was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, February 14 and
15 (the stunning event occurred precisely at 12 midnight)
1882.</p>

<p>His boyhood ambition was to be an African explorer
in a pith helmet, with plenty of room on the chest ribbon
for medals that would be bestowed upon him by the
beauteous Crown Princess of Luxembourg.</p>

<p>He was educated at Cornell University and the
University of Bologna, in Italy.</p>

<p>He is a man of middle height, straight, slim, dark,
with eyes like the middle of August, black hair which he
brushes back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la française</i>, and a rather sullen mouth.</p>

<p>He smokes from the moment his man turns off the
matutinal showerbath until his man turns it on again at
bedtime.</p>

<p>He rarely eats meat.</p>

<p>He lives in a bachelor apartment, nearly one-third of
which is occupied by an ice-box containing refreshing
beverages. On the walls of his apartment are the pictures
of numerous toothsome creatures. He is at the
present time occupied in writing a book describing his
sentimental adventures among them.</p>

<p>He has published the following books: “Europe After
8:15,” in collaboration with Mencken and Mr. Willard
Huntington Wright; “Another Book on the Theater,”
“Bottoms Up,” and “Mr. George Jean Nathan Presents.”</p>

<p>He has written for almost every magazine in America,
except <cite>Good Housekeeping</cite> and <cite>The Nation</cite>.</p>

<p>He dresses like the late Ward McAllister and wears
daily a boutonnière of blue corn flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>He dislikes women over twenty-one, actors, cold
weather, mayonnaise dressing, people who are always
happy, hard chairs, invitations to dinner, invitations to
serve on committees in however worthy a cause, railroad
trips, public restaurants, rye whisky, chicken, daylight,
men who do not wear waistcoats, the sight of a woman
eating, the sound of a woman singing, small napkins,
Maeterlinck, Verhaeren, Tagore, Dickens, Bataille, fried
oysters, German soubrettes, French John Masons,
American John Masons, tradesmen, poets, married
women who think of leaving their husbands, professional
anarchists of all kinds, ventilation, professional music
lovers, men who tell how much money they have made,
men who affect sudden friendships and call him Georgie,
women who affect sudden friendships and then call him
Mr. Nathan, writing letters, receiving letters, talking
over the telephone, and wearing a hat.</p>

<p>In religion he is a complete agnostic, and views all
clergymen with a sardonic eye. He does not believe
that the soul is immortal. What will happen after death
he doesn’t know and has never inquired.</p>

<p>He is subject to neuralgia. He is a hypochondriac
and likes to rehearse his symptoms. Nevertheless, a
thorough physical examination has shown that he is
quite sound. His Wassermann reaction is, and always
has been, negative. He is eugenically fit.</p>

<p>He never reads the political news in the papers. He
belongs to a college fraternity and several university
societies.</p>

<p>The room in which he works is outfitted with shaded
lamps and heavy hangings, and somewhat suggests a
first-class bordello. He works with his coat on and shuts
the windows and pulls down all the curtains. He writes
with a pencil on sheets of yellow paper. He cannot use
a typewriter.</p>

<p>He detests meeting people, even on business, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
swears every time a caller is announced at <cite>The Smart Set</cite>
office. He never receives a woman caller save with his
secretary in the room.</p>

<p>He wears an amethyst ring. In his waistcoat pocket
he carries an elegant golden device for snapping off the
heads of cigars. He has his shoes shined daily, even
when it rains.</p>

<p>Like the late McKinley, he smokes but half of a cigar,
depositing the rest in the nearest spitbox. Like Mark
Twain, he enjoys the more indelicate varieties of humor.
Like Beethoven, he uses neither morphine nor cocaine.
Like Sitting Bull and General Joffre, he has never read
the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>He bought Liberty Bonds. He can eat spinach only
when it is chopped fine. He knows French, Latin,
Italian, and German, but is ignorant of Greek. He plays
the piano by ear.</p>

<p>In his taste in girls, he runs to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-tasse</i>. I have
never heard of him showing any interest in a woman
more than five feet in height, or weighing more than
105 pounds.</p>

<p>An anarchist in criticism, he is in secret a very diligent
student of Lessing, Schlegel, Hazlitt, and Brandes. His
pet aversion, among critics, was the late William Winter.</p>

<p>He has no interest in any sport, save tennis and fencing,
and never plays cards. He never accepts an invitation
to dinner if he can avoid it by lying. He never goes to
weddings, and knows few persons who marry.</p>

<p>As a critic, he has been barred from many theaters.
A. L. Erlanger, in particular, is a manager who views
him as a colleague of Mephisto.</p>

<p>He eats very little.</p>

<p>He drinks numerous cocktails (invariably the species
known as “orange blossom,” to which he has added
two drops of Grenadine), a rich Burgundy, and, now and
then, a bit of brandy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>He once told me that he had no use for a woman who
wasn’t sad at twilight.</p>

<p>He has two male companions—so many and no more:
Mencken and John D. Williams, the theatrical producer.
He is rarely seen with any other.</p>

<p>He was born, as the expression has it, with a gold spoon
in his mouth. He has never had to work for a living.</p>

<p>He works daily from 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> until 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> He plays
from 5:30 until 8:30. Evenings, he spends in the theater.
After the theater, he has supper. He retires anywhere
from 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>He has made many trips abroad and has lived at different
times in France, England, Germany, Italy, Austria,
the Argentine, India, Japan and Algiers.</p>

<p>He fell in love at first sight in 1913 with a flower girl
in the Luitpold Café in Munich, but the hussy was
distant.</p>

<p>He would rather have Lord Dunsany in <cite>The Smart
Set</cite> once than William Dean Howells a hundred times.</p>

<p>He often writes sentences so involved that he confesses
he himself doesn’t know what they mean.</p>

<p>He admires Max Beerbohm, Conrad, Dr. Llewellys
Barker, Mozart, the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies and
the songs in “Oh, Boy,” sardines, ravioli, Havelock Ellis
chocolate cake, Molnar, Hauptmann, Royalton cigars,
Anatole France, <cite>Simplicissimus</cite>, <cite>E. W. Howe’s Monthly</cite>,
an eiderdown blanket and a hard pillow, a thick-toothed
comb and stiff brush, Schnitzler, bitter almond
soap, George Ade, Richard Strauss, Pilsner, Huneker,
Florenz Ziegfeld, Edwin Lefèvre’s story “Without End,”
the quartette in the Piccadilly in London, the Café Viel
in Paris, the overcoat shop in the Stefansplatz in Vienna,
the strawberries in the Palais de Danse in Berlin.</p>

<p>He believes, politically, in an autocracy of the elect,
for the elect, and by the elect.... His father was a
Democrat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>He has written one play, “The Eternal Mystery,”
which was produced on the Continent in 1914 and in
America in 1915. He has forbidden the production of
the play henceforth in any American city save Chicago,
in which city anyone who chooses may perform it without
payment of royalties.</p>

<p>In 1904 he won the Amsler gold medal for proficiency
with the foils. He studied fencing under Lieutenant
Philip Brigandi, of the Italian cavalry, and Captain
Albert Androux, the celebrated French master of foils.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes in the sun gives his complexion the
shade of mahogany; twenty minutes, the shade of Booker
T. Washington.</p>

<p>He wears the lightest weight underwear through the
coldest winter.</p>

<p>He owns thirty-eight overcoats of all sorts and descriptions.
Overcoats are a fad with him. He has them
from heavy Russian fur to the flimsiest homespun....
He owns one with an alpine hood attachment.</p>

<p>He belongs to several metropolitan clubs, but never
enters them.</p>

<p>He has never been in jail. He has been arrested but once:
at the age of twenty for beating up a street-car conductor.</p>

<p>He always has his jackets made with two breast pockets:
one for his handkerchief, the other for his reading glasses.
The latter are of the horn species.</p>

<p>His telephone operator, at his apartment, has a list
of five persons to whom he will talk—so many and no
more. He refuses to answer the telephone before five
o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>His favorite places of eating in New York are the
Café des Beaux Arts, the Kloster Glocke, and the Japanese
Garden in the Ritz.</p>

<p>He can down several hundred olives at a single sitting.</p>

<p>He knows more about the modern foreign theater
than any other American.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>He is a lineal descendant of Petöfi Sándor, the national
poet of Hungary, and of Thomas Bourgchier, archbishop
of Canterbury.</p>

<p>An examination of his blood, on July 1, 1917, showed:
Hb., 111%; W. B. C., 8,175. A phthalein test showed:
1st hr., 50%, 2d hr., 20%; total, 70%. Blood pressure:
129/77. Gastric analysis: Free HCl, 11.5%; combined,
20%. No stasis. No lactic acid.</p>

<p>He entered the New York Public Library for the first
time on March 7, 1917, being taken there by A. Toxen
Worm, of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>He never accepts a dinner invitation until invited
three separate times, and then usually sends his regrets
at the last moment.</p>

<p>The living Americans who most interest him are
Josephus Daniels and Frank A. Munsey.</p>

<p>The only poet that he admires is John McClure. He seldom
reads poetry. He has never read “Paradise Lost.”</p>

<p>He never visits a house a second time in which he has
encountered dogs, cats, children, automatic pianos,
grace before or after meals, women authors, actors,
<cite>The New Republic</cite>, or prints of the Mona Lisa.</p>

<p>He is not acquainted with a single clergyman, Congressman,
general, or reformer. He has never met any
of the Vice-Presidents of the United States.</p>

<p>He is free of adenoids.</p>

<p>His knee jerks are normal.</p>

<p>He has never been inside a church.</p>

<p>He has been writing dramatic criticism for thirteen
successive years, and in that time has seen more than
3000 plays in America, 400 in England, and 1900 on
the Continent. He has simultaneously syndicated critical
articles to as many as forty-two newspapers, and has
served as dramatic critic to seven metropolitan magazines.</p>

<p>In 1910, on a wager, he wrote sixteen magazine articles
in a single month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Among his short stories are “D. S. W.,” “Nothing
to Declare,” “But I Love Her,” “The Soul Song,” “The
Triple Expense,” etc.</p>

<p>Among his most widely quoted retorts is that made by
him to the newspaper interviewer who asked him if it
was true that a disgruntled theatrical manager named
Gest had alluded to him as a “pinhead.” “That,” replied
Nathan, “is on the face of it absurd. ‘Pinhead’ is a
word of two syllables.”</p>

<p>He once observed that the reason the galleries of our
theaters, as our theatrical managers lament, are no
longer filled with newsboys is that all the newsboys are
now theatrical managers.</p>

<p>He wrote the introduction to Eleanor Gates’ play,
“The Poor Little Rich Girl.”</p>

<p>He is the first American critic to have written of the
dramatists Molnar, Brighouse, and Bracco.</p>

<p>His mother’s family were the pioneer settlers of Fort
Wayne, Indiana. His father’s family were figures in the
continental world of letters. His father spoke eleven
languages, including the Chinese.</p>

<p>He frequently spends an entire afternoon polishing
up a sentence in one of his compositions. And he
often stops writing for a couple of days, or as long as
it takes him, to hit upon an appropriate adjective or
phrase.</p>

<p>He never writes love letters, and seldom reads them.</p>

<p>He cannot operate a motor car, or cook anything, or
wind a dynamo, or fix a clock, or guess the answer to
a riddle, or milk a cow.</p>

<p>He regards camping out as the most terrible diversion
ever invented by man.</p>

<p>He knows nothing of country life, and cannot tell a
wheat field from a potato patch. He regards all deciduous
trees as oaks, and all evergreens as cedars.</p>

<p>He has yet to drink his first glass of Hires’ Root Beer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>He regards Al Woods as the most competent commercial
manager in the American theater.</p>

<p>His library contains every known book on the drama
published in the English, French, German, and Italian
languages.</p>

<p>He owns many of the original Dunsany manuscripts.</p>

<p>Accused by certain of his critics of a flippant attitude
toward the drama, he in reality takes the drama very
seriously. The theater, on the other hand, he regards
four out of five times as a joke.</p>

<p>He concurs in the Walpole philosophy that life is a
tragedy to him who feels and a comedy to him who
thinks.</p>

<p>He is a good listener. His invariable practice with
talkers is to let the latter talk themselves out and then,
after a moment’s studious silence, to nod his head and
say yes. He never argues, never disagrees, no matter
how bizarre the conversationalist’s pronunciamentos.</p>

<p>The Paris journal, <cite>Le Temps</cite>, frequently translates his
critical articles and quotes from them copiously.</p>

<p>He owns an autographed photograph of the Russian
mystic, Rasputin, presented to him by the latter six
years ago.</p>

<p>He dislikes all forms of publicity. He has an aversion
to self-advertisement that amounts almost to a mania.
He believes, with Mencken, that whom the gods would
destroy, they first make popular.</p>

<p>He takes a companion with him to the theater only on
rare occasions. He uses the extra seat sent him by the
managers as a depository for his hat and overcoat.</p>

<p>He always has thirty or forty lead pencils beside him
when he writes. The moment one becomes a trifle dull
he picks up another. He cannot sharpen the pencils
well enough to suit himself and has the job done by his
secretary.</p>

<p>He hasn’t the slightest intention of ever getting married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>He believes that the motor trip from Watkins Glen
to Elmira, in New York State, is the most beautiful in
America.</p>

<p>Among the Presidents of the United States he admires
most—and by long odds—the late Grover Cleveland.</p>

<p>He believes the dirtiest spot in the world to be the
Azores.</p>

<p>He believes Shaw’s “Cæsar and Cleopatra” to be the
best modern British play, Brieux’s “Les Hannetons”
the best modern French play, and Dunsany’s “Gods of
the Mountain” the best modern Irish play.</p>

<p>He gets squiffed about once in six weeks, usually in
company with John Williams. He has a headache the
next day.</p>

<p>He carries a tube of menthol in his pocket and sniffs
at it forty times a day.</p>

<p>He has been writing his monthly article for <cite>The Smart
Set</cite> since 1909. He and Mencken became editors of
the magazine in August, 1914.</p>

<p>He began his career as a man of letters by reporting
for the New York <cite>Herald</cite>. He reads the <cite>Times</cite> and
<cite>Globe</cite> daily.</p>

<p>Among his critical contemporaries in New York he
has the highest respect for Louis Sherwin. Of American
dramatists he most admires Avery Hopwood. Of
American dramatic critics his vote is probably for Henry
T. Parker, of the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite>.</p>

<p>In his own opinion, the best thing he has ever written
is “The Eternal Mystery.”</p>

<p>He has never been to Washington, nor to California,
nor to Boston.</p>

<p>He has never made a speech, nor delivered a lecture,
nor sat on a committee. He has never subscribed to a
charity fund.</p>

<p>He wears a No. 14½ collar and No. 7¼ hat. His favorite
soup is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crême de Sante</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>The only author he ever invites to his office is Harry
Kemp. He detests Kemp’s poetry.</p>

<p>The temperature of his daily bath is 67 degrees.</p>

<p>A practitioner of preciosity in style, he nevertheless
dictates business and social letters in a “would say”
manner, and has his secretary sign them.</p>

<p>In 1900 he fought a duel with pistols outside of
Florence, Italy, and was wounded in the left shoulder.
He is still a trifle lame from the wound.</p>

<p>Returning to America in 1912 on the <em>Philadelphia</em>,
during a rough passage he was the only passenger on
the ship to appear in the dining saloon for four successive
days. With three of the stewards, he passed the time
by improvising a bowling alley in the saloon, utilizing
mutton chops for the pins and oranges for the balls. The
latter were automatically returned to the bowlers by
the ship’s periodical pitch backward.</p>

<p>He has had the same barber for fourteen years. Curiously
enough, the barber’s name is George J. Nath.</p>

<p>His valet’s name is Osuka F. Takami. The latter has
a penchant for polishing Nathan’s patent leather boots
with the sofa pillows.</p>

<p>He has seen only one vaudeville show in the last eight
years.</p>

<p>He believes that Herma Prach is the prettiest girl on
the Viennese stage and Gladys Gaynor the prettiest on
the London stage. He has never seen a pretty girl on
either the Berlin or Paris stage.</p>

<p>His headquarters in London is the Savoy; in Berlin,
the Adlon; in Vienna, the Grand; in Paris, the Astra.</p>

<p>He has never eaten a pickled eel, calf’s brains, chicken
livers, or tongue.</p>

<p>He has never been in a Childs’ restaurant or in Rector’s.</p>

<p>He is of a nervous temperament and the slightest
sound during the night wakes him up.</p>

<p>He looks seven years younger than he is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>He has been shot at three times in America, but never
hit.</p>

<p>He likes chop suey, spaghetti, French pastry, horseradish
sauce, Welsh rarebits, oysters <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Dumas</i>, raw
tomatoes, stuffed baked potatoes, green peppers, broiled
lobster, halibut, mushrooms cooked with caraway seeds,
and chipped beef.</p>

<p>His favorite American city is Philadelphia. His
favorite French, Barbizon. His favorite German,
Munich. His favorite English, Leeds.</p>

<p>He covered murder trials in various parts of the country
for the New York <cite>Herald</cite> during the years of his preparation
for dramatic criticism.</p>

<p>He wears tan pongee silk shirts in summer.</p>

<p>The New Yorkers he admires most are W. R. Hearst,
Arthur Hopkins, and M. Alevy, the eminent <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d’hôtel</i>
of the Café des Beaux Arts.</p>

<p>He is the only American dramatic critic who has never
succumbed to the Augustus Thomas, Granville Barker
or Belasco rumble-bumble.</p>

<p>He is entirely ignorant of mathematics, geology,
botany, and physics. Like Mencken, however, he is a
good speller, and is privy to the intricacies of punctuation.</p>

<p>The name of the girl who manicures his nails is Miss
Priscilla Brown. She is an orphan.</p>

<p>The claret he commonly serves to his guests costs
eighty-five cents a gallon, in quarts. He buys the labels
separately.</p>

<p>His favorite hospitals are the Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore,
and Galen Hall, in Atlantic City. Whenever he
is ill he goes to one or the other.</p>

<p>Since 1901 he has loved seventeen different girls, and
still remembers the names of all of them, and their preferences
in literature, food, and wines. Of the seventeen,
fourteen are happily married, one has been married and
divorced, and the rest have gone West.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>He owns three watches, seventeen scarf-pins, and
nineteen pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>His skull is sub-brachycephalic, with a cephalic index
of 83.1. His cranial capacity, by the system of Deniker,
is 1756 cc. His nose is mesorhinian, and his nasal index
is 46.2. The ratio between the length of his radius and
that of his humerus is as 73 is to 100.</p>

<p>By the Binet-Simon test his general intelligence is
that of a man of 117 years.</p>

<p>His voice is a baritone, with a range of one octave
and two tones.</p>

<p>He never answers questions put to him in letters.</p>

<p>A friend presented him several years ago with a set
of O. Henry, which, try as he will, he can’t get rid of.</p>

<p>He would rather eat a salt-sprinkled raw tomato still hot
from the sun than a dinner from the hand of a French chef.</p>

<p>He has everything he wears made to his order, save
his belts and his socks. He never buys even a hat that
is ready-made.</p>

<p>He has written under the pseudonyms of George Narét,
Rupert Cross, and William Drayham.</p>

<p>He has been denounced in the New York newspapers,
during his career as dramatic critic, by three playwrights,
five theatrical managers, eight actresses, twenty-two
actors, and almost everyone connected with vaudeville.</p>

<p>He likes garlic, but refrains from eating it.</p>

<p>He has read Max Beerbohm’s “Happy Hypocrite”
thirteen times.</p>

<p>Like Mencken, he is subject to periodic attacks of
melancholia.</p>

<p>He has visited every American resort north of Old
Point Comfort—and thinks them all pretty bad.</p>

<p>He believes the Ritz, in Philadelphia, to be the best
hotel in America.</p>

<p>He believes the Hudson Theater, in New York, to be
the most comfortable theater in America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Several years ago, seeking isolation in which to finish
a piece of work, he decided to shut his eyes, run his
finger down a New York Central time-table, and go
to the place opposite the name of which his finger
would come to a halt. His finger stopped opposite
an exotic something named New Paltz.... The first
person he saw when he got off at the New Paltz station
was the man he had roomed with in his junior year
at college.</p>

<p>He has said that “cleverness” consists merely in
saying the wrong thing at the right time.</p>

<p>He owns three suits of evening clothes.</p>

<p>He wears pongee pajamas.</p>

<p>His one-act play, “The Eternal Mystery,” which was
suppressed in New York and Detroit, created more discussion
than any one-act play produced in America in
the last dozen years.</p>

<p>He is kind to dogs, babies, and negroes. He has never
given a street beggar a cent.</p>

<p>Among his closest friends in Europe are Ballington
Booth, Jack Johnson, and M. Philippe Cartier, in charge
of the malt department on the Orient Express.</p>

<p>His most ingenious piece of dramatic criticism was
his criticism of the writings of Augustus Thomas, in which
he proved that Thomas’ plays would be better if they
were played backward.</p>

<p>His hair grows so quickly that he has to get a hair-cut
every ten days.</p>

<p>His father’s first name was Charles; his middle name,
Narét.</p>

<p>He likes hot weather, the hotter the better.</p>

<p>He believes the island of Bermuda to be the most
beautiful spot on earth. He would like to live there—if
he couldn’t live in Munich.</p>

<p>He once wrote an article on The Department of the
Interior for <cite>Munsey’s Magazine</cite>. He gave the proceeds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
by way of atonement, to the First Baptist Church of
Asbury Park.</p>

<p>He knew Evelyn Nesbit when she was a baby.</p>

<p>He believes that twelve per cent of all reformers and
uplifters are asses, and that the rest are thieves.</p>

<p>He wears low, Byronic collars and rather gaudy neckties.</p>

<p>In philosophy he is a skeptical idealist, believing that
the truth is an illusion and that man is a botch. He
has read the works of Kant, Fichte, and Locke, but can’t
remember what was in them. He regards Schopenhauer,
on the woman question, as a sentimentalist whistling
in the dark.</p>

<p>His knowledge of economics is extensive, and he once
wrote a pamphlet against David Ricardo. It has been
translated into French, German, and Bohemian.</p>

<p>He has never written any poetry in English, but published
a slim volume of Petrarchan sonnets in Italian
during his student days in Bologna. The only copy of
this book known to exist is in the library of Balliol College,
Oxford. The author’s own copy was lost in the burning
of the Hôtel de France at Lausanne, in the winter of
1903.</p>

<p>He is an excellent Latinist and has translated Albius
Tibullus.</p>

<p>His favorite opera is Gluck’s “Iphigénie in Tauris.”
He once traveled from Nice to Dresden to hear it. His
chief abomination in the opera house is “The Jewels of
the Madonna.”</p>

<p>While on the staff of the New York <cite>Herald</cite>, James
Gordon Bennett offered him the post of London correspondent.
The emolument proposed, however, made
Nathan laugh.</p>

<p>He owns three top hats, fourteen walking sticks, and
two Russian wolf-hounds.</p>

<p>He writes with a Mikado No. 1 lead-pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>He is on good terms with but two members of his
family.</p>

<p>He reads, on the average, one hundred and fifty foreign
plays every year.</p>

<p>He has read every book on the drama published in
America, England, France, and Germany since 1899.</p>

<p>He uses Calox tooth powder, Colgate’s shaving soap,
a double strength witch hazel, a Gillette razor, and Kitchell’s
Horse Liniment. He has never taken quinine,
Peruna, Piso’s Cough Syrup, Sanatogen, asperin, morphine,
opium, or castor oil—but he has taken everything
else.</p>

<p>He believes Mencken eats too much.</p>

<p>He has been inoculated against typhoid.</p>

<p>He once, as a boy, ran a railroad locomotive from
Cleveland, Ohio, to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, killing only
two cows.</p>

<p>He gets a cinder in his eye on an average of twice a
day.</p>

<p>He can drink anything but sweet cordials.</p>

<p>With his meals, he uses Cross and Blackwell’s chow-chow.</p>

<p>In his undergraduate days he was an editor of all the
Cornell University papers.</p>

<p>He wrote articles on the theater for the old <cite>Harper’s
Weekly</cite> for four years.</p>

<p>He knows three jockeys, eight bartenders, one murderer,
two sea captains, three policemen, one letter
carrier, and one politician.</p>

<p>He is a warm friend of Detective William J. Burns.</p>

<p>He likes buttermilk.</p>

<p>Christmas costs him, on the average, about a thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>For the last two years he has received weekly anonymous
letters from some woman in Bridgeport, Connecticut,
who signs herself with the initials “L. G.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>He is writing the introduction to Arthur Hopkins’
new book on the drama.</p>

<p>He has not ridden a horse since May 22, 1908.</p>

<p>In October, 1912, he and his broker were wrecked off
Barnegat in the latter’s yacht, <em>Margo I</em>, and were rescued
via a breeches buoy by the Barnegat life-saving crew.</p>

<p>He never reads popular novels.</p>

<p>Mr. Winthrop Ames has invited him to write a satirical
review for his Little Theater in New York and Nathan
is planning to do the thing during 1918.</p>

<p>He eats two raw eggs a day to put on weight.</p>

<p>When the victim of a bad cold and unable to smoke,
he chews soft licorice candy while writing.</p>

<p>He believes that George Bickel is the funniest comedian
on the American stage, that Arnold Daly is the best
actor, that Margaret Illington is the best actress.</p>

<p>He has never written a thing that, upon rereading
after its appearance in print, didn’t seem to him to be
chock full of flaws.</p>

<p>He is lucky at games of chance, though he seldom
plays. In 1912 he won $2,000 in the Havana lottery.</p>

<p>He owns six belts, one of them presented to him by
Gabriele D’Annunzio and made of wolf hide.</p>

<p>He is in favor of universal military service, imperialism,
and birth-control, but is opposed to woman suffrage,
the direct primary, and prohibition.</p>

<p>His usual pulse is 71 a minute. After drinking it
rises to 85.</p>

<p>He keeps no books of account, and does not know his
exact income. As a means of defense against sudden
calamity he keeps $3000 in gold in a safe deposit vault.</p>

<p>His favorite name for girls is Helen.</p>

<p>If he could rechristen himself, he would choose the
given name of John.</p>

<p>He pronounces his middle name, not in the French
manner, but to rhyme with bean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>He is a third cousin of Signor Enrico Nathan, the late
Socialist mayor of Rome. His uncle, Dr. Émile Nathan
van der Linde, <em>privat docent</em> in anthropology at Leyden,
was killed by savages in Borneo in 1889, while a member
of the Oesterling exploring expedition.</p>

<p>He has never visited the battlefield at Gettysburg.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="H_L_MENCKEN">H. L. MENCKEN</h2>
</div>

<p>He was born at Baltimore on Sunday, September 12,
1880, and was baptized in the Church of England.</p>

<p>He was educated at the Baltimore Polytechnic, and
is theoretically competent to run a steam engine or a
dynamo, but actually is quite incapable of doing either.</p>

<p>Down to the age of fifteen it was his ambition to be a
chemist, and to this day he is full of fantastic chemical
information and fond of unloading it. At the age of
fourteen he invented a means of toning photographic
silver prints with platinum.</p>

<p>The family business was tobacco, and he was drafted
for it on leaving school. He became a journeyman
cigar-maker, and can make excellent cigars to this day.
But when chemistry and business died out, literature
set in, and he took to journalism.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-three he was city editor and at
twenty-five managing editor of the Baltimore <cite>Herald</cite>,
now defunct—the youngest managing editor of a big
city daily in the United States.</p>

<p>He printed a book of poems at twenty-two—now a
rare <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bibelot</i>. He was “discovered,” as the saying is, by
Ellery Sedgwick, now editor of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>,
but then running <cite>Leslie’s Monthly</cite>. He and Sedgwick
have remained on friendly terms to this day, but he
sometimes writes for the <cite>Atlantic</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1900, having read Lafcadio Hearn’s “Two Years
in the French West Indies,” he shipped on a banana boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
for the Spanish Main, and has returned to the West
Indies three times since.</p>

<p>He is five feet, eight and a half inches in height, and
weighs about 185 pounds. In 1915 he bulged up to 197
pounds. Then he took the Vance Thompson cure and
reduced to 175, rebounding later.</p>

<p>The things he dislikes most are Methodists, college
professors, newspaper editorials (of which, in his time,
he has written more than 10,000), Broadway restaurants,
reformers, actors, children, magazine fiction, dining out,
the New Freedom, prohibition, sex hygiene, <cite>The Nation</cite>,
soft drinks, women under thirty, the nonconformist conscience,
Socialism, good business men, the moral theory
of the world, and the sort of patriotism that makes a
noise.</p>

<p>Among the men he admires are Joseph Conrad, W. R.
Hearst, E. W. Howe, Richard Strauss, Anatole France,
and Erich Ludendorff—this last because he is a great
general and has never uttered a single word of patriotic
or pietistic cant. He likes Dreiser, but does not admire
him.</p>

<p>His taste in female beauty runs to a slim hussy, not
too young, with dark eyes and a relish for wit. He abhors
sentimentality in women, holding that it is a masculine
weakness, and unbecoming the fair. He seldom falls
in love, and then only momentarily.</p>

<p>He wears buttoned shoes because he cannot tie shoe
laces. Neither can he tie a dress tie; if there is no one
to tie it for him he has to miss the party. In general,
he is almost wholly devoid of manual dexterity, though
he can play the piano well enough to entertain himself,
and is a good sight reader.</p>

<p>The only art that ever stirs him is music. He views
literature objectively, almost anatomically. He is anæsthetic
to painting. His favorite composers are Beethoven,
Haydn, Mozart, Brahms, and Richard Strauss.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
He detests Tschaikowsky and Rossini, and likes Wagner
better out of the opera house than in it. In his youth
he wrote waltzes. He abominates song and piano recitals
and oratorios. He has a pretty extensive knowledge of
musical technique, and knows a sound sonata from a
bad one. When he improvises it is usually in F major.
He has a poor ear and cannot tune a fiddle.</p>

<p>He drinks all the known alcoholic beverages, but
prefers Pilsner to any other; a few seidels make him
very talkative. In the absence of Pilsner, he drinks
Michelob. He seldom drinks at meals and often goes
three or four days without a drink. In wine, he likes
whatever is red and cheap. He detests champagne,
Scotch and rye whisky, and gin, though he drinks them
all to be polite. He has a good head, and is not soused
more than once a year, usually at Christmas.</p>

<p>He has good eyes and a gentle mouth, but his nose is
upset, his ears stick out too much, and he is shapeless
and stoop-shouldered. One could not imagine him in
the moving pictures. He has strong and white, but
irregular teeth.</p>

<p>He wears a No. 7½ hat. He is bow-legged. He is a
fast walker. He used to snore when asleep, but had his
nasal septum straightened by surgery, and does so no
longer.</p>

<p>He takes no interest whatever in any sport. He
played baseball as a boy, but hasn’t seen a game for ten
years, and never looks at the baseball news in the papers.
He cannot play tennis or golf, and has never tried. He
knows nothing of cards. He never bets on elections or
horse-races. He never takes any exercise save walking.</p>

<p>He rejects the whole of Christianity, including especially
its ethics, and does not believe that the soul is immortal.
His moral code is from the Chinese and has
but one item: keep your engagements. He pays all bills
immediately, never steals what he can buy, and is never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
late for an appointment. He has missed but one train
in his life.</p>

<p>He believes in war so long as it is not for a moral cause.
He advocates universal military training on the ground
that it causes wars.</p>

<p>His table manners are based upon provincial French
principles, with modifications suggested by the Cossacks
of the Don.</p>

<p>When at home he arises at eight sharp every morning,
and is at his desk at nine.</p>

<p>He likes to go motoring at night, and often sets out
alone at midnight.</p>

<p>He takes a half hour’s nap every afternoon. He can
sleep anywhere and at almost any time.</p>

<p>He has eleven uncles and aunts and eighteen cousins,
and has never quarreled with any of them.</p>

<p>He has been inoculated against typhoid and hay fevers.</p>

<p>He is a prompt correspondent, and answers every
letter the day it is received.</p>

<p>He keeps his watch on an old-fashioned clothes-press
in his workroom, and winds it every time he looks at it.</p>

<p>He detests windy days. As between heat and cold,
he prefers heat.</p>

<p>He never preserves love letters, and never writes them.</p>

<p>His tonsils have been cut out. His Wassermann
reaction is and always has been negative. He has a low
blood pressure. His heart and kidneys are normal.</p>

<p>His favorite hotel is the Bayrischer Hof at Munich.
After that he ranks them in the following order: the
Adlon, Berlin; the Palace, Madrid; the Paladst, Copenhagen;
the Statler, Buffalo; the Edouard VII, Paris.</p>

<p>He says the best place to eat in the whole world is
at the basement lunch counter of the Rennert Hotel,
Baltimore. The best things to order there are oyster
potpie, boiled turkey with oyster sauce, Virginia ham
and spinach, and boiled tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>He owns ten suits of clothes, and wears them seriatim.
All of them are of summer weight. He never wears
heavy clothes.</p>

<p>He never wears patent leather shoes, even with dress
clothes. He wears horn spectacles for reading, but
never otherwise.</p>

<p>Between 1899 and 1906 he wrote and published thirty-five
short stories. Since 1906 he has written none.</p>

<p>For five years he contributed a daily article to the
Baltimore <cite>Evening Sun</cite>. His total writings for newspapers
run to nearly 10,000,000 words. He has reported
three national conventions and nine executions.</p>

<p>His one-act play, “The Artist,” has been translated
into German, Dano-Norwegian, Italian, and Russian.</p>

<p>He has twice voted for Roosevelt, not by conviction,
but because he believes Roosevelt gives a better show
than any other performer in the ring. In politics he is
a strict federalist.</p>

<p>He advocates woman suffrage on the ground that, if
women voted, democracy would be reduced to an absurdity
the sooner.</p>

<p>He is very polite to women, particularly if he dislikes
them, which is usually.</p>

<p>He owns the original manuscript of “Sister Carrie,”
presented to him by Dreiser.</p>

<p>He is a nephew of the late Right Rev. Frederick Bainville
Mencken, bishop of Akkad <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in partibus infidelium</i>.
This uncle was disinherited by his grandfather as a
result of a family dispute over transubstantiation.</p>

<p>His pet literary abominations are “alright” (as one
word) and the use of “near” as an adjective. He will
never speak of or to an author who uses either.</p>

<p>His favorite eating places in New York are Rogers’,
the Kloster Glocke, the Lafayette, and the Café del
Pezzo.</p>

<p>The cities he likes best are Munich, Chicago, Baltimore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and London. He dislikes Paris, Rome, Berlin, and
New York—the last-named so much that, whenever
he has any work to do, he goes to Baltimore to do it.</p>

<p>He was an intimate friend of the late Paul Armstrong
for many years and never quarreled with him.</p>

<p>In his own opinion, the best thing he has ever written
is “Death: a Discussion” in his “Book of Burlesques.”</p>

<p>He wears B. V. D.’s all the year round, and actually
takes a cold bath every day.</p>

<p>He never has his nails manicured, but trims them with
a jacknife.</p>

<p>Every Saturday night he spends the time between
8 and 10 playing music, and the time between 10 and 12
drinking Michelob. He plays second piano.</p>

<p>He has received three proposals of marriage, but has
never succumbed. He has never seduced a working
girl. He has no issue.</p>

<p>He works in his shirt-sleeves and sleeps in striped
pajamas.</p>

<p>He wears Manhattan garters, No. 15½ Belmont collars,
and very long-tailed overcoats. His plug hat, which he
wears but two or three times a year, has a flat brim, like
that of a French comedian.</p>

<p>He is smooth-faced and shaves every morning with a
Gillette safety razor. Once, while in Paris, he grew a
yellow moustache and goatee. They lasted, however,
but two weeks.</p>

<p>He has lived in one house in Baltimore for 34 years.
In it he has 3000 books.</p>

<p>He owns the largest collection of Ibseniana in the
world, including autographs, first editions, and other
rarities. Part of it is in Baltimore, part in Copenhagen,
part in Munich, and part in Geneva.</p>

<p>He reads German and Norwegian fluently, French,
Spanish, Italian, and Latin less fluently, and makes shift
to sweat through the following: Russian, Greek, Dutch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Rumanian, Serbian, Czech, Sanskrit, Assyrian, Hungarian,
and Swedish.</p>

<p>His favorite American poet is Lizette Woodworth
Reese. He and she have lived in the same city for years,
but they have never met.</p>

<p>His total receipts in royalties on his books, in fifteen
years, have been $172.50.</p>

<p>His personal funds are invested in bonds of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, the Midvale Steel Company, and the
Danish, Chilean, and Swiss governments.</p>

<p>During his newspaper career he was American correspondent
of the Hongkong <cite>Press</cite>, the Kobe <cite>Chronicle</cite>,
and the Colombo (Ceylon) <cite>Observer</cite>.</p>

<p>One of his fads is theology. He understands its technical
terminology, and is sometimes consulted on difficult
points by both Catholic and Protestant clergy.</p>

<p>Down to July 7, 1913, he employed suspenders to hold
up his trousers. Being then convinced by Nathan that
such appliances had a socialistic smack, he abandoned
them for a belt.</p>

<p>He reads an average of ten books a week, in addition
to those he goes through for reviewing purposes. The
subjects he affects are theology, biology, economics, and
modern history.</p>

<p>He has never read George Eliot, or Jane Austen, or
Bulwer-Lytton. He has never been able to read Dostoievsky,
or Turgeniev, or Balzac. His favorite writers, as
a youth, were Thackeray, Huxley, and Kipling. He
seldom reads newspapers. The only magazines he ever
looks at are the <cite>Smart Set</cite>, <cite>Ed Howe’s Monthly</cite>, the <cite>Country
Gentleman</cite>, the <cite>Masses</cite>, the <cite>Seven Arts</cite>, and the <cite>Ladies’
Home Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>He has a wide acquaintance among medical men and
knows a good deal about modern medical problems. His
advice is often sought by persons seeking treatment;
he gives it copiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>He knows mathematics up to plane geometry and
trigonometry. He knows philosophy, chemistry, and
history, but is ignorant of physics and grammar. He
can draw with some skill, and was once a good mechanical
draftsman. He is an excellent speller and knows how
to punctuate.</p>

<p>In philosophy he is a strict mechanist of the Loeb-Haeckel
school. In psychology he leans toward Adler.
He questions pragmatism, but admits its workableness.
He is an advocate of absolute free speech in all things—and
exhibits the utmost intolerance in combatting those
who oppose it.</p>

<p>He believes and argues that sex is a vastly less potent
influence in life than the Puritans and psychanalysts
maintain. He advocates the establishment of
lay monasteries for men who care for neither God nor
women.</p>

<p>When he is at home he lunches at noon and dines at
six. He never eats between meals. He never takes a
drink before dinner save when on holiday.</p>

<p>He most often begins his letters to men with the salutation
“My dear Mon Chair.” To women, “My dear
Mon Chairy.”</p>

<p>A March ago, he attempted to give up smoking and
sought to alleviate his longing for the weed by sucking
slippery elm. He was again pulling at a stogie the
following month.</p>

<p>He has probably done more for talented young writers
who have tried in vain to get a hearing with publishers
than any other American critic. Of all those whom he
has helped to obtain an hospitable ear, only one has ever
so much as thanked him.</p>

<p>He forgives anything in a friend—theft, perjury, or
stupidity—anything save hypocrisy. But he has no
use for loyalty in others. “Loyalty,” he says, “is the
virtue of a dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>He pokes fun at modern musical comedy, particularly
the music thereof. Yet he has never heard “Sari” or
“The Purple Road,” or the best of the last dozen scores
of Victor Herbert.</p>

<p>He believes, with Nathan, that the three best stories
printed in <cite>The Smart Set</cite> under their joint editorial direction
have been “The Exiles’ Club,” by Dunsany; “Ashes
to Ashes,” by James Gardner Sanderson; and “The End
of Ilsa Menteith,” by Lilith Benda. He believes, like
Nathan, that the most charming sentimental story
printed in <cite>The Smart Set</cite> has been Lee Pape’s “Little
Girl.” He believes, with Nathan, that the best epigram
has been that sent in by an anonymous contributor:
“When love dies there is no funeral. The corpse remains
in the house.”</p>

<p>He met Nathan for the first time in the chateau of
the Comtesse Hélène de Firelle in the valley of the Loire,
on August 10, 1906. Three days later they left together
for a trip to Munich, to drink the waters.</p>

<p>One of his best pieces of humor is a pun on “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non compos
mentis</i>.” I cannot print it.</p>

<p>A healthy man, he yet complains hourly of imaginary
ailments.</p>

<p>He has never seen Coney Island.</p>

<p>When in his cups, he imagines himself a proficient
bass singer.</p>

<p>In the last three years he has been to the theater but
once. On this occasion he accompanied Nathan to a piece
called “Common Clay.” He remained twenty minutes.</p>

<p>He uses handkerchiefs two feet wide.</p>

<p>He always fights with Nathan for the bar or dinner
check. His records of victories is eight per cent.</p>

<p>Like Nathan, he dislikes to talk about business affairs
or to listen to anyone talk about business affairs. Both
he and Nathan leave their finances entirely in the hands
of their competent partner, E. F. Warner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>He and Nathan plan some day to collaborate on a
satirical farce with scenes laid in a Turkish harem.</p>

<p>In conversation he is given to an immoderate employment
of the word “bemuse.”</p>

<p>He believes the following to be his best epigram: “An
anti-vivisectionist is one who gags at a guinea pig and
swallows a baby.” To the contrary, I believe his best
to be: “The charm of a man is measured by the charm
of the women who think that he is a scoundrel.”</p>

<p>He wrote dramatic criticisms in Baltimore for four
years. At the end of that period, unable longer to bear
the idiocies of the local theaters, he inserted a $200 half-page
advertisement in each of the Baltimore newspapers
to the effect that he would cause the arrest of the next
manager who sent him tickets.</p>

<p>He loves cocoanut pie.</p>

<p>He smokes cigarettes only on rare occasions. He is
not used to them and, on such occasions, holds the cigarette
gingerly, as if it were going to bite him.</p>

<p>Present at a mixed conversation, he frequently dozes
off to sleep.</p>

<p>When in New York, every night before retiring he
eats a dozen large clams.</p>

<p>He never drinks beer save in seidels.</p>

<p>He has been to the Horse Show but once. On this
occasion he remained three minutes.</p>

<p>He does not dance.</p>

<p>In Paris, in 1913, he hailed Nathan on the latter’s
way to Southampton with this wireless: “Get off Cherbourg
and come direct Paris. Have discovered place
where they have good beer.”</p>

<p>He is unable to sit at table upon finishing dinner. With
the arrival of the finger-bowl he is off for a walk.</p>

<p>He is, at bottom, a sentimentalist. True, he has no
use for such things as babies, love stories (however good),
or the Champs Élysées in the springtime (once while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
walking up the boulevard with Nathan he deplored the
absence on it of a first-class drugstore), yet he succumbs
moistly to Julia Sanderson singing, “They Wouldn’t
Believe Me,” to a cemetery in the early green of May, to
the lachrymose waltz from “Eva,” which he plays upon
the piano in a melancholious <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pianissimo</i>, and to any poem
about a dog (however bad).</p>

<p>His trousers are never creased. His clothes are always
of a navy blue shade. He never wears a waistcoat.
He buys the best cravats that can be obtained for fifty
cents.</p>

<p>He loves liqueurs, preferably <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crême de cacao</i>. They
always make him feel badly the next morning.</p>

<p>He has written the following books: “A Book of
Prefaces,” “A Little Book in C Major,” “A Book of
Burlesques,” “The Battle of the Wilhelmstrasse,” “The
Artist,” “The Gist of Nietzsche,” “The Philosophy of
Friedrich Nietzsche,” “Europe after 8:15” (in collaboration
with Nathan and Wright), “Men <em>vs.</em> the Man” (in
collaboration with R. R. La Monte), and “George Bernard
Shaw: His Plays.” The latter was the first book on
Shaw ever published.</p>

<p>He eats and enjoys all varieties of human food. There
is no dish that he doesn’t eat. He has eaten snails,
frogs, eels, octopus, catfish, goat meat, and Norwegian
cheese. He thinks that the best roasts are the English,
the best table wines the Spanish, the best pastry the
Danish, the best soups the German, and the best cooking
the French.</p>

<p>He has visited the following countries: England,
Holland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Germany, Austria,
Russia, Spain, France, Switzerland, and Cuba. He has
never been in Canada or Mexico, and has never been
further West than St. Louis.</p>

<p>He has been under rifle and shell fire in this war, on
the eastern front, and was glad to get under cover. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
has been in France, Germany, and Russia during the war.
He was nowhere mistaken for a spy, and was always
treated courteously. He says that 99 per cent of the
authors of war books are liars.</p>

<p>His family is well-to-do, and he has never been dead
broke.</p>

<p>He has never seen a moving picture show.</p>

<p>He is opposed to vice crusades, holding that the average
prostitute is decenter than the average reformer. He
ascribes the crusading spirit, following Freud, to a suppressed
and pathological sexuality.</p>

<p>He wears (and owns) no jewelry whatever, not even
a scarfpin, but he sports a formidable Swiss watch, with
a split second hand and a bell that strikes the quarter
hours. He never wears gloves save in intensely cold
weather.</p>

<p>He owns and drives a 1916 Studebaker car, and never
has it washed.</p>

<p>Once, on receiving an amorous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billet doux</i> from a fair
admirer, he sent it back to the writer with a <cite>Smart Set</cite>
rejection slip.</p>

<p>He frequently carries on a perfectly innocent conversation
with Nathan in a low stage whisper, thus
lending to his most trivial remarks a secret and sinister
import.</p>

<p>He introduced the new widespread use of “jitney” as
an adjective. He also coined the words “smuthound” and
“snouter,” both designating a “malignant moralist”—another
of his invention.</p>

<p>While playing the piano, he keeps the loud pedal glued
to the floor from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">couvert</i> to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coda</i>.</p>

<p>He and Nathan, in all the years of their friendship,
have quarreled but once. This was in the late summer
of 1916, when Mencken was suffering from a violent
attack of hay fever and insisted upon going to bed one
night at eleven o’clock, thus leaving the disgusted Nathan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
to kill time as best he could until midnight, at that period
his hour for retiring.</p>

<p>He never wears rubbers, carries an umbrella, or wears
a mackintosh. He likes to walk in the rain and get wet.</p>

<p>He alludes to all actors as “cabots.” For the plural
of “genius” he uses “genii.”</p>

<p>He travels with a suitcase large enough to transport
a circus.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-nine he was invited to join the
Elks.... The judge, a friend of his, reduced the charge
from “assault with intent to kill” to “assault and battery.”</p>

<p>He has never had typhoid fever, smallpox, cholera,
scarlet fever, arthritis, appendicitis, or delirium tremens.
He has never had a headache. He can digest anything.</p>

<p>He has been involved, in his time, in eight lawsuits,
and has won them all, chiefly by perjury.</p>

<p>His first name is Henry; his middle name, Louis. He
never spells them out, signing himself always simply
H. L.</p>

<p>He drinks a brand of cheap claret which he lays in
in shipments of ten cases.</p>

<p>He has presented the steward of the Florestan Club,
of Baltimore, with a bronze medal for reviving Maryland
hoe cake.</p>

<p>A life-long opponent of Puritanism in all its forms, he
is on good personal terms with many Puritan reformers,
and always reads the tracts they send to him.</p>

<p>He has been arrested four times, once in Paris, once in
Copenhagen, and twice in America. He was acquitted
each time, though guilty.</p>

<p>He complains ceaselessly over what it costs him to live.
Yet he is a liberal fellow and keeps Nathan supplied
with cigars. The cigars, however, are not to Nathan’s
taste.</p>

<p>He is an omnivorous borrower of matches.</p>

<p>He washes his hands twenty-four times a day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>He writes directly upon the typewriter, never longhand.
He signs all his letters with the episcopal “Yours
in Xt.”</p>

<p>For the last four years he and Nathan have been
planning a motor trip through Virginia. They will
never make it, both agree emphatically.</p>

<p>His favorite dish is anything <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Créole</i>.</p>

<p>He once brought from abroad, as a gift to his negro
cook, three dozen strings of Venetian beads. She is a
strict Baptist and declined to wear them.</p>

<p>His favorite novel is “Huckleberry Finn”; his favorite
name for a woman, Maggie.</p>

<p>He often goes without breakfast, and never eats more
than an apple and a slice of dry bread.</p>

<p>He and Nathan have their secretaries in <cite>The Smart
Set</cite> offices keep a list of forty-two bad writers. Opposite
the name of each of the forty-two is the fine one must
pay the other if the name is uttered by either.</p>

<p>He slicks his hair down like the actor who plays the
heroic lieutenant in the military dramas.</p>

<p>He likes to ride down Fifth Avenue in a victoria.</p>

<p>He owns a plaid shirt. He wears it.</p>

<p>He has worn the same straw hat for five years. He
cleans it every spring with a tooth-brush dipped in
bicarbonate of soda and Pebeco tooth paste. Each
spring he buys a new tooth-brush.</p>

<p>He writes in a bare room. There is no carpet or
rug on the floor. The only pictures on the wall
are portraits of his great-great-grandfather, Ibsen,
Conrad, Marcella Allonby, Mark Twain, and Johannes
Brahms.</p>

<p>He sleeps on a sleeping porch adjoining his office. He
uses, as a blanket, a Persian shawl presented to him by
the late Lafcadio Hearn.</p>

<p>He has read 9872 bad novels during his active life
as a literary critic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>He is an artist of no mean ability. His portrait of
Nathan, reproduced in the Chicago <cite>Daily News</cite> in May,
1917, attracted wide attention and, among other things,
brought him requests for sittings from Hamlin Garland,
William Lyon Phelps, and Robert B. Mantell.</p>

<p>He clips the ends off his cigars with his side teeth.</p>

<p>He has written under the pseudonyms of William R.
Fink, William Drayham, John F. Brownell, Harriet
Morgan, W. L. D. Bell, Gladys Jefferson, and Baroness
Julie Desplaines.</p>

<p>He sees nothing beautiful about the Hudson from
Riverside Drive, but believes St. Thomas’s to be one of
the most beautiful churches in the world.</p>

<p>He collects odd pieces of furniture, Japanese wood
carvings, and bad plaster of paris casts.</p>

<p>He knows two actors, George Fawcett and Frank
Craven.</p>

<p>He was taught how to swim by John Adams Thayer.</p>

<p>He is the author of a farce that has played on Broadway
for one hundred nights. To this authorship, no one save
Nathan, James Huneker, A. H. Woods, and myself have
been privy.</p>

<p>His high-water marks in the matter of malt bibbing
are as follows: Pschorrbräu, Munich, 8 <em>masses</em> in two
hours and seven minutes; Appenrodt’s, Paris, 9 <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">seidels</i>
in one hour and a quarter; Lüchow’s, New York, 13
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">seidels</i> and one glass in one hour, twenty-one minutes
and twelve seconds. Timers: Pschorrbräu, Arthur
Abbott, H. B. M. vice-consul; Appenrodt’s, Pierre
Disdebaux, of Marseilles, France; Lüchow’s, Theodore
Dreiser, of Warsaw, Indiana, U. S. A.</p>

<p>He was a regular reader of the <cite>Boston Transcript</cite>, the
New York <cite>Times</cite>, and the <cite>Youth’s Companion</cite>, up to the
age of ten.</p>

<p>He believes W. L. George to be the best of the younger
English novelists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>His signature runs up hill.</p>

<p>He has been cured of hay-fever and is at present writing
a pamphlet extolling the discoverers of the cure.</p>

<p>He admires the kind of Munich “art” that is sold in
the Fifth Avenue shops at $4.35 the picture.</p>

<p>He likes to look in shop windows. He has never
ridden in a Ferris Wheel.</p>

<p>He laments the fact that he gets no exercise and contemplates
fixing up a carpenter shop in the basement of
his house in Baltimore, so that he may saw and chop
his arms back into muscular shape.</p>

<p>He numbers the paragraphs of his letters and never
writes more than six paragraphs.</p>

<p>The English critics hailed his Nietzsche book as the
best thing of its sort that had come out of America.</p>

<p>He has never read Shakespeare’s “Venus and Adonis”
or “Pericles, Prince of Tyre.”</p>

<p>He believes that all fat women are sentimental and
says that the publisher who will edit a magazine for this
clientèle will make a fortune. Inasmuch as magazine
fiction heroines are at present always slim, elf-like creatures,
he contends that the sentimental fat girl never
gets a fair chance to enjoy herself, and that, accordingly,
a magazine with no heroine weighing less than one hundred
and ninety pounds would in one year put Cyrus K. Curtis
in the pauper class.</p>

<p>Like Nathan, he believes that the theory that it is
difficult to make money is poppycock. If one is willing
to give the public what it wants, anyone—argue these
two—can get rich very quickly. To prove their contention,
they outlined plans for several cheap magazines
three years ago, which, upon being put into circulation,
proved immediate and overwhelming successes. Mencken
and Nathan, at the end of six months, sold their joint
interest for $100,000. They argue that the thing is
as simple as rolling off a log, and that any person who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
is interested in this sort of thing may become a Street-and-Smith
or Munsey overnight.</p>

<p>At the age of nineteen, he invented a slot machine for
the vending of patent medicines on excursion boats.</p>

<p>He has read “Huckleberry Finn” twenty-seven times.
He reads the book once a year, regularly.</p>

<p>He has never seen Mrs. Castle, Mary Garden, Ann
Pennington, Maurice and Walton, Mary Pickford, or
Secretary Lansing.</p>

<p>He has shaken hands with Billy Sunday.</p>

<p>Wherever he goes he carries a Corona typewriter. He
paid $50 cash for it, but nevertheless he has given the
manufacturers an eloquent testimonial. He writes on
cheap newspaper copy-paper.</p>

<p>He is fond of candy.</p>

<p>He is an ardent defender of organized charity, arguing
that it helps progress by making charity difficult and
obnoxious.</p>

<p>He is often mistaken for a misogynist. He is actually
a strict monogamist. He believes that all men are
naturally monogamists, and that polygamy is due to
vanity.</p>

<p>He began to edit the plays of Ibsen in 1910, but
abandoned the enterprise after he had issued “A Doll’s
House” and “Little Eyolf.”</p>

<p>He is a bitter opponent of Christian Science, and has
written all sorts of things, from epigrams to long articles,
against it.</p>

<p>The La Mencken cigar, once popular throughout the
South, was not named after him, but after his father.</p>

<p>He is a good sailor, and has been seasick but once—on
a 1000-ton British tramp in a West Indian hurricane.</p>

<p>In blood he is chiefly Saxon, Danish, Bavarian, and
Irish—no Anglo-Saxon, no Prussian, no Latin. The
portraits of his Saxon forefathers show strong Slavic
traces. He is the present head of the family. A Mencken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
in the seventeenth century, founded the first scientific
review in Europe. Another was privy councilor to
Frederick the Great. Another was rector of the University
of Leipzig. Yet another was chief justice of the
supreme court there. A Mlle. Mencken was the mother
of Bismarck.</p>

<p>The Menckenii were converted to Christianity in
1569, but returned to paganism during the Napoleonic
wars, in which twelve of them were killed and sixty-three
wounded.</p>

<p>The present Mencken is an amateur of military science,
and has written a brochure, privately printed, on the
Battle of Tannenberg.</p>

<p>He writes very slowly and laboriously, save when writing
for newspapers. Then he is highly facile, and can turn
out a two-column article in three hours. He has never
learned to dictate.</p>

<p>He used to have a mole on the back of his neck, but
had it removed in the summer of 1913.</p>

<p>He is not afraid of the dark, or of spiders, or of snakes,
or of cats. He likes dogs better than any other animals,
and regards them as more respectable than men.</p>

<p>If he could choose another given name it would be
Francis.</p>

<p>He owns two hundred acres of land near Innsbruck,
in the Tyrol, and will build a bungalow on it after the
war.</p>

<p>He is a violent anti-Socialist, as “Men <em>vs.</em> the Man”
shows, but he reads all the new Socialist books.</p>

<p>In American history the men he most admires are
Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Cleveland. He
has a low opinion of Lincoln, Jackson, and Bryan.</p>

<p>He is handy with horses, and can drive four-in-hand.</p>

<p>He detests cut flowers, carpets, the sea-shore, hotels,
zoological gardens, the subway, the Y. M. C. A., literary
women, witch hazel, talcum powder, limp leather bookbindings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
aerated waters, bottled beer, low collars, public
libraries, and phonographs.</p>

<p>He is a Cockney, and prefers the city to the country.</p>

<p>He never wears tan shoes.</p>

<p>He can swallow castor oil without disgust and without
needing a chaser, but he never does so.</p>

<p>Next to Pilsner and Burgundy (or, in wartime, Michelob)
his favorite drink is city water direct from the tap—no
ice.</p>

<p>He chews cigars.</p>

<p>He is a very fast reader and can get through a two hundred-page
book in an hour.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>So much for my observations and investigations of
the two gentlemen, MM. Nathan and Mencken. I have
told you, not everything that is known about them, nor
even all that I know myself, but enough, I hope, to enable
you to conjure up colorable images of them. As I have
said, it is by such small and often grotesque lights that
character is genuinely illuminated—not by the steady
and distorting glare of orthodox biography. It remains
for me to tell you how they do their joint work—work
which rests upon the apparently perilous basis of an
absolute equality of authority, for each owns exactly
the same amount of stock in <cite>The Smart Set</cite> Company
that the other owns, and each is editor equally with the
other, and both derive from the property exactly the
same revenue, to a cent.</p>

<p>Their system is very simple and admirably workable.
When either, by any internal or external process, generates
an idea for the conduct of the magazine, he lays
it before the other in all its details. This is always done
in writing; never orally. If the other approves the idea
he writes upon the brief the words “Nihil obstat,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
it is forthwith executed. If, on the contrary, he disapproves,
he indorses it with the word “Veto” and it
is returned. The same idea may be revived by its author
thirty days later, but not before. If thrice vetoed it is
forever banned. The office records for the past three
years yield the following:</p>

<table class="autotable">

<p>In the handling of manuscripts they pursue a somewhat
analogous system. Mencken never reads manuscripts
while in New York; all such work he does in
Baltimore. As the offerings of authors are received
in the office they are scrutinized by Nathan’s secretary,
and the following classes are weeded out and immediately
returned:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mss. written in pencil or with green, purple, or red
typewriter ribbons.</p>

<p>Mss. fastened together with ribbons or pins.</p>

<p>Mss. radiating any scent or other odor.</p>

<p>Mss. of plays which begin with soliloquies into a telephone.</p>

<p>Mss. bearing the recommendations of the editors of
other magazines.</p>

<p>Mss. accompanied by letters of more than one hundred
words.</p>

<p>Mss. accompanied by circulars advertising books
written by their authors or by other printed matter.</p>

<p>Mss. of poetry by poets whose names do not appear
upon a list in the possession of the secretary.</p>
</div>

<p>Once this preliminary clearing out is accomplished, the
manuscripts that remain are shipped to Mencken, and he
reads them within twenty four hours. Those that he rejects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
are returned to their authors. Those that he approves
are returned to Nathan, with the Dano-Norwegian word
“bifald,” signifying assent, written across the first page
of each. They are then read by Nathan, and if he agrees
they are purchased and paid for at once. If he disagrees
they are returned without further process. Once a
manuscript is bought it goes to Mencken a second time,
and he reads it again. If he finds that it needs revision
in detail, it is turned over to his private secretary and
valet, an intelligent Maryland colored man named
William F. Beauchamp, a graduate of Harvard. After
it has passed through Beauchamp’s hands it is set up in
type. In case Mencken deems it necessary to reject a
manuscript by an author who must be treated politely,
he sends it back with a note putting the blame on Nathan.
In case Nathan, in like circumstances, votes no, he blames
it upon Mencken. This, of course, is lying, but in the
long run it amounts to the truth. The two never discuss
manuscripts; they simply vote. They never buy anything
from personal friends. They have a strict agreement,
in fact, that each will automatically veto anything
sent in by an author with whom he is on good terms.
This agreement is never violated. Nathan, for example,
has a brother who, under a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i>, is a frequent
contributor to the leading magazines, but is barred from
<cite>The Smart Set</cite> by the relationship. In the same way
Mencken was, until recently, the intimate friend and confidant
of an eminent woman novelist, but her work has
never appeared in <cite>The Smart Set</cite>.</p>

<p>When Mencken is in New York, he and Nathan meet
at <cite>The Smart Set</cite> office every day, including Sunday, at
10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and spend two hours discussing the minor business
of the magazine. At noon they proceed to Delmonico’s
and have luncheon, returning at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> They
finish all business by 4:30, when they leave the office.
They often dine together and spend the evening together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
but they never discuss office matters at such times. They
never invite authors to luncheon or dinner and never
accept invitations from them. They never attend
literary parties or visit studios. They are not acquainted
with any of the literary lions of New York, saving only
Dreiser and Huneker.</p>

<p>Thus these meritorious <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">redacteurs</i> live and have their
being. Neither belongs to a literary clique; neither
subscribes to a clipping bureau; neither ever sits on a
committee or joins a movement; neither needs money;
neither ever borrows anything or asks a favor; neither
is accountable to anyone; neither is ever indignant;
neither gives a damn.</p>
